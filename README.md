# AQI_Prediction using Long Short Term Memory Models

### Problem Statement
In this project our main aim was to develop an efficient approach for forecasting the air quality index of Bangalore using meteorological parameters and concentration of major air pollutants using various Machine Learning Algorithms and Deep Neural Networks like LSTM.

### Data Collection
Meteorological parameters like Maximum temperature (°C), Minimum temperature (°C), Average relative humidity (%), Total rainfall and / or snowmelt (mm), Average visibility (Km), Average wind speed (Km/h), Maximum sustained wind speed (Km/h) were taken from TuTiempo.net.

Concentration of various Air Pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3 were used. This data was collected from Kaggle.
